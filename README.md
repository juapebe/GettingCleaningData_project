This set of files was built as a project for the Coursera online class "Getting and Cleaning Data".  

>*Purpose of the assignment (as provided by instructors):
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.*    

The main part of the assignment submission is the `run_analysis.R` script. A full description of how the script works, as well as an explanation of the variables present in the output files can be found in the file `CodeBook.md`.
